# Reading Comprehension of Abstract Meaning

This project was done under the course CS779A in the Fall 2020 Semester at IIT Kanpur.

The aim of the project is to work on the SemEval-2021 Task 4: Reading Comprehension of Abstract Meaning. 

Abstractness has 2 definitions, imperceptibility and non-specificity. The sub tasks 1 and 2 focus on these definitions separately and combine them in Task 3.

There are 3 branches in this repository.

1. *master*: Contains the Training, Prediction and Evaluation code for Tasks 1 and 2.

2. *GAReader*: Contains the baseline model provided by the organizers: Gated Attention Reader.

3. *ensemble*: Ensemble of pre-trained BERT and XLNet language modelling heads.
